This project is a derivative of an existing CLI client (me-cli). I only modify and extend it; I am not the original author.

## PS for Certain Indonesian mobile internet service provider

Instead of just delisting the package from the app, ensure the user cannot purchase it.
What's the point of strong client side security when the server don't enforce it?
